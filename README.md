# Emotion-to-music-generator
The system uses emotion–music mapping rules to set tempo, scale, pitch, and rhythm for each emotion. When a user selects an emotion, the FastAPI backend generates MIDI notes using MIDIUtil, creating melodies that reflect the emotion—bright for happy, slow for sad, and intense for anger.
